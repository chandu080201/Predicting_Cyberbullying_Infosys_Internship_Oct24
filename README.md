### 🚀 End-to-End Flask-Based AI Application for Detecting Cyberbullying on Social Media Platforms

**This project leverages Machine Learning and NLP techniques to identify cyberbullying in social media text.** Built with Flask, the web application allows users to input social media text and receive real-time analysis, categorizing messages as non-toxic or cyberbullying-related.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Cyberbullying is a growing concern in today's digital world. This Flask web application enables real-time cyberbullying detection using **Machine Learning models**, including **Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting, and Naive Bayes**.
